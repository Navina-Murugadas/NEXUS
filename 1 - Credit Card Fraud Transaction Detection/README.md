# Fraud Detection Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Fraud Detection Project! This project focuses on building a robust Fraud Detection model using a Credit card transaction dataset. The primary goal is to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within credit card transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It consists of credit card transactions, and the challenge is to develop a model capable of distinguishing legitimate transactions from fraudulent ones.

## Project Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth exploration of the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and formatting the dataset for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selection of relevant features and creation of new features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection:** Exploration of various algorithms, with the Decision Tree Classifier chosen for its interpretability and non-linear relationship capturing.
- **Model Training:** Training the Decision Tree Classifier on the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the Decision Tree Classifier's hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- **Prediction:** Applying the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of the entire project, including methodologies and decisions made.

## Results and Conclusion
Explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed results, visualizations, and insights obtained from the fraud detection model. The project aims to create a secure and reliable system for credit card transaction monitoring.

## Future Enhancements
The project provides a solid foundation for fraud detection, but there are opportunities for improvement:
- Conduct deeper analysis of feature importance.
- Explore real-time monitoring for dynamic fraud detection.
